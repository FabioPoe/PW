Here i had my h5py file of all preprocessed images from domoritz, but it is way to big for github.
You can make the file yourself by downloading the data from the AWS S3 bucket of "https://github.com/domoritz/label_generator" and then by processing the data with the code from the file "data_preprocessing.py"
