# Intro
This repository displays the code from my practical work project, which focussed on extracting information from images of visualisations, the files have some comments in them which should make them understandable, but for the best understanding i would recommend reading my report, which is named report.pdf, if there are still some questions after reading that, feel free to contact me.

# How to run my code
To run my code first you need to install tesseract, and then a environment which fulfills the requirements in environment.txt needs to be installed, if one has conda, one can just run the command:
$ conda env create –name <environment name> –file <filepath
of environment.yaml>
after this the environment should be set up and the only thing left to change in the code would be some absolute paths, like the path of tesseract, or where data is stored.
